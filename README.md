# EU Council vote app

## Description

This project simulates voting in the EU Council. It is similar to [the "official" voting calculator of the EU](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/council-eu/voting-system/voting-calculator/) but offers enchanched features like voting by groups and is designed to embed it seamlessly into other pages.
